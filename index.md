# Recent Open Source contributions:
## Software
* [Opinionated.tf - Opinionated Terraform Modules](https://github.com/matthewbaggett/terraform_modules) - A large collection of opinionated Terraform modules that mostly lego-brick their way together using traefik and a few choice design decisions. Not everything in here is fully fleshed out, but most of it is in use somewhere.
* [S3DB](https://github.com/benzine-framework/s3db) - A S3-backed ephemeral database built ontop of postgres or mysql. Intended for use in short-lived and non-mission-critical QA environments.
* [Benzine Framework](https://github.com/benzine-framework) - All of the components I build and reuse live under this psuedo-organisation/brand.
* [Docker Base Images](https://github.com/benzine-framework#docker-images) - A set of well-built, multi-process PHP and NodeJS images using runit for service startup
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/benzine-framework#actions) - A set of Github Actions that I use to build and deploy my projects.

## Hardware

  <img style="clear: right; float: right" alt="Image of the TI badge as a render" src="./images/ti_badge.png">
</a>

* [TechInc Badge](https://code.techinc.nl/grey/badge) - A badge for the TechInc hackerspace in Amsterdam. It is a work in progress but recently had its first prototype run of the front display assembly. It features a 70x40 pixel mono OLED display, a few buttons, an accelerometer and a USB C charge port. Driving it is a f1c200s linux SoC and a RP2040 microcontroller, plus power + battery management.
* [Tamagotchya](https://matthewbaggett.github.io/Tamagotchya) - A **WIP** 2019 Tamagotchi Clone featuring Wifi, Bluetooth and a 128x64 pixel oLED display, 5 way D pad and an accelerometer and a USB C charge port.
  <a href="/images/traffic_light.mp4"><img style="float: right" alt="Small toy traffic light now wifi-controlled" src="./images/traffic_light.png"></a>
* [Traffic Light](https://matthewbaggett.github.io/Traffic-Light/) - I saw a small, cheap traffic light toy in Spain. I figured it'd make a fun desk ornament. And then I realised it'd juuuust fit an ESP8266 module inside it. Pictured is one of the two traffic lights with the circuitry fitted, a spare infront of it with the programming header still attached for illustration. Click the picture to see a short video clip of it cycling. It runs Tasmota under the hood and is plugged into Home-Assistant. At the time, it signalled system 'health' as an on-desk chotchky for monitoring systems.
* [Hexagon LEDs](https://matthewbaggett.github.io/Hexagon-LED) - Build a small, inexpensive hexagonal lighting PCB with an inexpensive microcontroller that can communicate using slow-speed software serial with the other attached nodes and to an optionally fitted ESP8266 ESP-01 module which will designate itself the "host", and populate out colour information from the center. This project was scuppered by the 2020-2022 chip crisis.
  <img style="clear: right; float: right" alt="Image of the TI badge as a render" src="./images/axp2101_breakout.png">
* AXP2101 Breakout - The [AXP2101](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/X_PowersTech-AXP2101/C3036461) is a really neat PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit) found in a lot of low-end laptops, smartphones etc. It has an interesting featureset, but its minimal circuit is relatively complicated, and requires reflowing a hard-to-hand-assemble (but not impossible) QFN40 package, so I designed a breakout for it to make it hobby-accessible. It has a lot of features like battery management/protection, current metering, e-gauge (where it meters the columbs of energy inserted/removed from the lithium cell) and dynamically programmable voltage rails: 4 high-efficiency high-power buck converters, and 11 LDOs. It also has some other trick features like a hardware watchdog and soft-touch power on/off features for your product.
